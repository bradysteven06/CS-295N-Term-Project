            The original Donkey Kong is definitely an '80s icon. Not only did it help establish Nintendo as a classic household name,
            but it gave the world its first taste of a certain portly plumber with a red hat and mustache. More high-concept than most old arcade games,
            Donkey Kong was something of a revolution when it hit arcades.

            There's probably not a gaming enthusiast out there who hasn't picked up some iteration of Tetris.
            At the bare minimum, the iconic puzzle title is perhaps the most accessible game on the list,
            appearing in arcades, consoles, and most famously the Gameboy.

            <h5 class="mt-0">Pac-Man(1980)</h5>
            Pac-Man as a character alone is a character most '80s kids easily recognize. The original Maze Runner,
            Pac-Man is a game that has consumed more quarters than most and has since been established as an icon of the industry.
            Its reputation has certainly only grown with the introduction of new video game consoles and newer ways to play.
